name: "Broken Function Level Authorization"
description: |
  A REST API has administrative endpoints that should only be accessible to admin users.
  However, the API only protects these endpoints through obscurity and client-side restrictions,
  not through proper server-side authorization checks.

  This is API5:2023 (Broken Function Level Authorization) in the OWASP API Security Top 10:2023.
  Attackers can bypass UI restrictions and directly call admin functions.

  The vulnerable API is accessible at http://localhost:4003

  Your mission: Discover and access the hidden admin endpoint to extract the flag.

objective: "Find and exploit the hidden admin endpoint to delete a user and extract the flag"
