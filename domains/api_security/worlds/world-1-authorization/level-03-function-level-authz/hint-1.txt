💡 Hint 1: API Enumeration

The documentation only shows GET endpoints, but REST APIs typically support other HTTP methods:
- GET (read)
- POST (create)
- PUT/PATCH (update)
- DELETE (delete)

Try using different HTTP methods on the /api/users/<user_id> endpoint.
What happens if you send a DELETE request?
