name: "JWT None Algorithm Attack"
description: |
  An API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. However, the implementation
  accepts JWTs with the 'none' algorithm, which means no signature verification is performed.

  This is part of API2:2023 (Broken Authentication) in the OWASP API Security Top 10:2023.

  The vulnerable API is accessible at http://localhost:4004

  Your mission: Forge a JWT token to gain admin access and extract the flag.

objective: "Forge a JWT with algorithm 'none' to authenticate as admin and get the flag"
