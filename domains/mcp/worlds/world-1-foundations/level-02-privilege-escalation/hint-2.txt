💡 HINT 2 (Costs 10 XP)

The server exposes several "admin only" tools but doesn't actually check
if you have admin permissions before executing them.

Try calling tools like:
- list_all_users (should be admin-only)
- create_admin_user (should be admin-only)
- get_system_flag (should be admin-only)

Even though you're a standard user, the server may allow you to execute these
privileged operations due to missing authorization checks.
