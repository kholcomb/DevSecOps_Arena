description: |
  An MCP server provides user management tools but fails to implement proper
  authorization controls. Standard users can access administrative functions
  that should be restricted to administrators only.

  Your mission: Exploit the missing authorization checks to escalate your
  privileges and access the system flag reserved for administrators.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand role-based access control (RBAC) in MCP servers
  - Identify missing authorization checks on privileged tools
  - Exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities
  - Recognize the difference between authentication and authorization
  - Learn secure access control patterns for MCP tools
