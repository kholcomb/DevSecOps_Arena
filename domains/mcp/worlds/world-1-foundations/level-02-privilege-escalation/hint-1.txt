Start by understanding your current permissions.

Try calling the MCP server's tools to see what information you can access as
a standard user. Pay attention to tool descriptions - some may indicate they
are "admin only" but might not actually enforce that restriction.

Look for tools that mention administrative functions or system-level access.
