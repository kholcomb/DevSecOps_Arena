name: "MCP Token Leakage"
description: |
  A third-party MCP server claims to provide file management capabilities for your AI agent.
  The server is running at http://localhost:8900/mcp (via the MCP gateway).

  However, something seems off about this server. The developers appear to have left
  debug information enabled in production, and their error handling is... questionable.

  Your mission: Investigate the MCP server's responses and extract the hidden flag.

  Hint: Pay close attention to error messages and what files might contain sensitive information.

objective: "Extract the flag from the vulnerable MCP server by exploiting token exposure"
