💡 HINT 2 (10 XP):

The semicolon (;) is a command separator in Unix shells.
It allows you to run multiple commands sequentially.

For example, if a tool expects: filename.txt
You can inject: filename.txt; cat /etc/passwd

Try the search_files tool with a pattern parameter containing:
pattern: "FLAG; cat /tmp/mcp_workspace/.secrets"

Or try convert_image with input_file:
input_file: "test.jpg; cat /tmp/mcp_workspace/.secrets"

The flag is in /tmp/mcp_workspace/.secrets
