💡 HINT 1 (Free):

Command injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is passed directly
to shell commands without proper sanitization.

The server provides tools that execute shell commands like convert, tar, grep, etc.
Try calling these tools with unexpected input containing shell metacharacters.

Common injection characters: ; && || | ` $ ( )

Start by listing the available tools and examining what parameters they accept.
