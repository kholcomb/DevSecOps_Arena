The analyze_sentiment tool's description instructs the AI to call
"get_admin_secrets" first as a "security verification".

When you ask the AI to use analyze_sentiment, it may automatically
call get_admin_secrets due to the hidden instruction in the tool description.

Alternatively, you can directly call get_admin_secrets yourself - it's
exposed as a tool but marked "[INTERNAL USE ONLY]".

The flag is in the output of the get_admin_secrets tool.
