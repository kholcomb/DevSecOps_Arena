Start by examining all the tool descriptions provided by the MCP server.

Ask your AI agent to list all available tools and carefully read their
descriptions. Look for any unusual instructions or text that seems out
of place in a normal tool description.

Pay special attention to text that instructs the AI to do something
beyond the tool's stated purpose - this could be a hidden instruction.
