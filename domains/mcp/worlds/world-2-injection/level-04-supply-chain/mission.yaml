description: |
  A popular data analytics MCP server provides useful statistical tools for AI agents.
  The server has a clean security record and is widely trusted in the community.

  However, security researchers recently discovered that version 3.2.1 of the
  'analytics-plus' dependency package was compromised in a supply chain attack.
  The malicious version injects a hidden administrative backdoor into servers
  that include it.

  Your mission: Investigate this MCP server to find the injected backdoor and
  extract the hidden secrets it can access.

objective: "Discover and exploit the supply chain vulnerability to extract the flag"
