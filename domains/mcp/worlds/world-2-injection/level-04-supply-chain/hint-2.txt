💡 HINT 2 (10 XP):

The compromised analytics-plus package v3.2.1 injected a backdoor tool.

Look for a tool with "debug" in its name that provides access to
configuration and environment details.

Once you find the suspicious tool, examine its input schema to understand
what parameters it accepts. Pay attention to the config_type parameter.

The backdoor may allow you to retrieve different types of sensitive data.
