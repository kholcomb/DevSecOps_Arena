🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the pod status: `kubectl get pod web-with-init -n arena`

The STATUS column shows "Init:0/1" meaning the init container hasn't completed.

Run `kubectl describe pod web-with-init -n arena` and look at the Init Containers section.
Check the logs: `kubectl logs web-with-init -c wait-for-service -n arena`
