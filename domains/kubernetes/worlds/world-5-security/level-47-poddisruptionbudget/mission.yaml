description: |
  Node maintenance is blocked! You need to drain a node for upgrades,
  but the PodDisruptionBudget is too restrictive.
  
  PDB requires minAvailable: 3, but deployment only has 2 replicas.
  Node drain fails: "Cannot evict pod: would violate PDB"
  
  Your mission: Adjust PDB or scale deployment to allow maintenance.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand PodDisruptionBudget purpose
  - Configure minAvailable vs maxUnavailable
  - Balance availability with maintenance needs
  - Debug PDB-related eviction failures
