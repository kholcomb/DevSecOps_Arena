🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the deployment's rollout strategy:
`kubectl get deployment critical-api -n arena -o yaml | grep -A 5 strategy`

Look at `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge`. What do you notice?

Try triggering a rollout (change image tag):
`kubectl set image deployment/critical-api api=hashicorp/http-echo:0.2.3 -n arena`

Watch what happens to pods:
`kubectl get pods -n arena -l app=api -w`

Do ALL pods terminate at once? That would cause downtime!
