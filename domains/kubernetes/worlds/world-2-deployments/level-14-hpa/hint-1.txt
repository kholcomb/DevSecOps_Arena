🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the HPA status:
`kubectl get hpa -n arena`

Look at the TARGETS column. Do you see "<unknown>/50%"?

Describe the HPA:
`kubectl describe hpa web-backend-hpa -n arena`

Look at the Conditions section. What error message do you see?

Try getting pod metrics:
`kubectl top pods -n arena`

Does it work?
