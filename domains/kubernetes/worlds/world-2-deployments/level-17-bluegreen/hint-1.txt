🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the deployments:
`kubectl get deployments -n arena`

You should see app-blue and app-green, both with 3/3 replicas.

Check the service:
`kubectl get service app-service -n arena -o yaml | grep -A 5 selector`

Which version is it pointing to?

Check the endpoints:
`kubectl get endpoints app-service -n arena`

Try to access the service and see which version responds:
`kubectl run -it --rm test --image=busybox --restart=Never -n arena -- wget -q -O- app-service`
