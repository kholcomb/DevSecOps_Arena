🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the pods:
`kubectl get pods -n devsecops-arena -l app=slow-app`

Do you notice the READY column? Some pods might show "0/1" even though STATUS is "Running".

Check the service endpoints:
`kubectl get endpoints slow-app-service -n devsecops-arena`

Are unready pods being added to the service? This would send traffic to pods that aren't ready yet!

Try describing a pod that's not ready:
`kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n devsecops-arena`
