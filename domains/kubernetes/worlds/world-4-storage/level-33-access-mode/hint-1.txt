🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's see why only one pod is starting:

1️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pods -n devsecops-arena -l app=web
   
   How many are Running? How many are stuck?

2️⃣ Describe a stuck pod:
   kubectl describe pod <stuck-pod-name> -n devsecops-arena
   
   Look for "Events" section - what does it say about volumes?

3️⃣ Check the PVC:
   kubectl get pvc shared-pvc -n devsecops-arena
   kubectl describe pvc shared-pvc -n devsecops-arena
   
   What's the access mode?

4️⃣ Check the PV:
   kubectl get pv -o wide
   
   What access mode does it show?

📝 Key Observation:
The storage has an access mode that only allows ONE pod to mount it at a time!

🤔 Questions:
• What is ReadWriteOnce?
• What about ReadWriteMany?
• Can multiple pods share ReadWriteOnce volumes?
