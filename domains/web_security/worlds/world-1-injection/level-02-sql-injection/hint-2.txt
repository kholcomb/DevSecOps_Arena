You can bypass authentication by commenting out the password check:

Username: admin'--
Password: (anything)

The '--' comments out the rest of the SQL query, so the password check is ignored.

The resulting query becomes:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'-- AND password = 'anything'

Everything after '--' is ignored by the database.
