The login form constructs a SQL query using string concatenation:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user_input' AND password = 'password_input'

Try injecting SQL syntax into the username field to manipulate the query logic.
Think about how you could make the WHERE clause always evaluate to true.
