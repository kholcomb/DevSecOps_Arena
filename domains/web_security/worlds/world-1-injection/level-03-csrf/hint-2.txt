Steps to execute the CSRF attack:

1. Open http://localhost:3003 in your browser
2. Login as alice (password: password123)
3. Keep that tab open (stay logged in)
4. Open http://localhost:3004 in a new tab
5. Click the "Claim Your Prize!" button
6. Go back to the banking app tab and refresh

The hidden form on the attacker's page will submit a transfer request using alice's session.
